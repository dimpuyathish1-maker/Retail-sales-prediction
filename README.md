Built a predictive model using Random Forest Regression to forecast weekly sales for Walmart stores. Performed full data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, creating lag and rolling statistics), engineered additional temporal features (year, month, week, day, season), and created store-level signals such as store average sales. Split data into training and testing sets, trained the Random Forest model, and evaluated performance using RMSE and R². Analyzed feature importance to understand key drivers of sales such as lag values, rolling averages, and economic factors (CPI, Fuel Price, Unemployment).
